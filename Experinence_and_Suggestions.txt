It was a great experience of learning python (somewhat new to me), getting idea about ML and how one module can manage all the maths in back and ahving enthu to complete assignments ASAP. Also having evening sessions was interesting (although I missed some of them) like understanding some terms, also revising some concpts we already discussed and the best part is that it was along with programming sessions. I think we all learnt many things in this bootcamp.
